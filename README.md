# Sentinel Blue-green Algae Test
Determine whether Sentinel satellite data can be used to map extent and severity of Blue-Green Algae outbreaks in the Gippsland Lakes

## Background:
Toxic algal blooms are a frequent occurrence in the Gippsland Lakes and require emergency response & monitoring.
High-resolution satellite imagery & data are available through Sentinel Hub, and a quick look returned some encouraging images using custom scripts provided by other users: 

#### Ulyssys Water Quality Viewer (UWQV)
A custom script to dynamically visualize the chlorophyll and sediment conditions of water bodies on Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 images. Authored by by Andr치s Zlinszky and Gergely Pad치nyi-Guly치s. Winner of the 2nd Sentinel Hub Custom Script Contest.

#### Sentinel-2 Water Quality (Se2WaQ)
The Se2WaQ - Sentinel-2 Water Quality - script by Nuno Sid칩nio and Andrade Pereira uses Sentinel-2 products (L1C & L2A) to display the spatial distribution of six relevant indicators of water quality: (i) the concentration of Chlorophyll a (Chl_a), (ii) the density of cyanobacteria (Cya), (iii) turbidity (turb), (iv) colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), (v) dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and (vi) water color (Color).

## Method:
1. Capture satellite data (requires relatively clear conditions at time of satellite fly-over).
2. Collect water samples to match.
3. Test whether usable relationships exist between satellite data and lab results from water testing.
